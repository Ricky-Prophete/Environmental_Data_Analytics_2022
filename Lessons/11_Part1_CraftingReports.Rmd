## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1. **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom
    + YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    + More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet
2. **R Code Chunks** surrounded by ``` on top and bottom
    + Create using `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
    + Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    + Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted
3. **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document

## THE KNITTING PROCESS
-   The knitting sequence  
    ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)
    

* Knitting commands in code chunks:
 - `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file
 - `echo = FALSE`    - code not included in knitted file, but results are
 - `eval = FALSE`    - code is not run in the knitted file
 - `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file
 - `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...
 - `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results


## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?
See: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and class recording.

 * Languages other than R...
 * Various outputs...

## WHY R MARKDOWN?

<Fill in our discussion below with bullet points. Use italics and bold for emphasis (hint: use the cheat sheets or `Help` →`Markdown Quick Reference` to figure out how to make bold and italic text).> 

- Enable organization of R Code
- Different Coding Languages
- Manage how code/products are displayed
- Add formatted text along w/ code
- All text based - good for reproducibility

## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

Dataset  | Details
------------- | -------------
NEON_Litterfall  | Contains literfall and fine woody debris sampling data
EPAair_PM25andO3  | Contains data from air quality monitoring of PM2.5 and ozone in North Carolina in 2017 and 2018


## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).

```{r install.packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('knitr')
```


### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.

Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.

Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
getwd()

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)


new_theme <- theme_bw(base_size = 13) + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.position = "right")+
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        panel.border = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"))
theme_set(new_theme)

Nutrients.raw <- read.csv('../Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv', stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

head(Nutrients.raw)

Nutrients.raw$sampledate <- as.Date(Nutrients.raw$sampledate, format = '%m/%d/%y')

```

### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

```{r, processed dataset, echo=FALSE}
Nutrients.processed <- Nutrients.raw %>% select(-c(lakeid, depth_id, comments)) %>%
  filter(depth == 0) %>%
  drop_na()

```


Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

```{r summary stats, echo=FALSE}
#Summary stats for total nitrogen
Nutrients.summary.tn_ug <- Nutrients.processed %>% group_by(lakename) %>%
  summarize(mean_tn_ug = mean(tn_ug),
    min_tn_ug = min(tn_ug),
    max_tn_ug = max(tn_ug),
    sd_tn_ug = sd(tn_ug))

#Summary stats for total phosphorus
Nutrients.summary.tp_ug <- Nutrients.processed %>% group_by(lakename) %>%
  summarize(mean_tp_ug = mean(tp_ug),
    min_tn_ug = min(tp_ug),
    max_tn_ug = max(tp_ug),
    sd_tn_ug = sd(tp_ug))

```

Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

```{r summary tables, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

knitr::kable(Nutrients.summary.tn_ug, caption = "Surface Samples: Total Nitrogen")


knitr::kable(Nutrients.summary.tp_ug, caption = 'Surface Samples: Total Phosphorous')



```


Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.

```{r Nitrgen plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.cap="Total Nitrogen Over Time", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

plot1 <- ggplot(data = Nutrients.processed, aes(x=sampledate,y=tn_ug,color=lakename)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  labs(x = 'Date', y = "Total Nitrogen", color = 'Lake')
plot(plot1) 
    
```

```{r Phosphorus plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.cap='Total Phosphorus Over Time', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

plot2 <- ggplot(data = Nutrients.processed, aes(x=sampledate,y=tp_ug,color=lakename)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Total Phosphorus", color = "Lake")
plot(plot2)  

```

### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?

> Between the years of 1991 and 1999, observed levels of nitrogen across East Long Lake, West Long Lake, Tuesday Lake, Paul Lake, and Peter Lake have fluctuated, but couriously, 1999 levels of nitrogen are at or near 1991 levels for these lakes. Nitrogen levels were most elevated between 1996 and 1998 across East Long Lake, West Long Lake, and Peter Lake. With respect to phosporus levels, a similar patter of fluctuation between 1991 and 1999 can be observed, though 1999 phosphorus levels for East Long Lake and West Long Lake remain elevated relative to 1991 levels. nitrogen and phosporus readings are most consistent in Paul Lake and Tuesday Lake.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> This lake data might help me better understand seasonal variations in nitrogen and phosporus levels, and whether similar trends are observed among proximate lakes experiencing ostensibly similar climactic and ecological inputs. I would conduct statistical and time series analysises to deconstruct these trends and determine the statistical significance of similarities and differences. 


## KNIT YOUR PDF
When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include: 

* Table of contents
* Number sections
* Control default size of figures
* Citations
* Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))

pdf_document:  
    toc: true  
    number_sections: true
